# Grading

Wow, impressive work! =) You clearly can do much more than what is even required in this course. Really interesting analysis, cool visualization, and well written code! You use modularization which is really good, and used a lot of techniques that weren't taught during the course. I also learned something new as the f-formatting of strings weren't familiar to me earlier, quite handy! 

Some minor things that I noticed was that all functions were not documented in a systematic way using docstrings, but that is a detail. 

Some further things that you might want to consider in the future, if you're interested, is writing tests for your functions e.g. using a package called [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) as tests are quite critical in software development. When writing functions, a good practice is having an idea that basically a single function should only do a single thing, which helps a lot when writing meaninful tests. You might also want to make your module installable by creating a setup.py file on the root of the project with MANIFEST.in file. After this you can install the package with pip in a similar manner as any Python package. Here you can get a pretty okay overview how to do it (example from Flask but similar things apply more generally): [http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/distribute/](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/distribute/). 

Really nice work and thanks for taking the course!

### What does it take to get the best grade?

`Urban indicator` assignments and own custom assignments are evaluated individually and the grade is based on the merits of the work. For getting the best possible grade from the final work, following things are considered:

 - Are functions used in the code?
 - Is there good documentation of the tools (docstrings, comments etc) and a written report?
 - Does the work demonstrate well how the analyses were done / tools are used?
 - Are there visualizations? At least a single map should be in place, after all, this is a GIS course.
 - Is the code written in modular way e.g. writing functions into separate script (or start of the script) and importing/using them?
 - Is the extent of the work sufficient? 
    - There is no clear rule what is "sufficient", but considering the fact that final assignment replaces an exam, the final work needs to have merits and demonstrate the skills that have been learned during the course. Hence, a "shorter" work with stylish code and good programming practices can be as good (or better) than a longer report with simple analyses / "unsophisticated" programming practices.

All of these do not need to be in place, but these are used as guidance for grading.

## Grades

- Final assignment: 5/5.
- Exercises: 5/5.
- **Total grade of the course: 5/5.**
